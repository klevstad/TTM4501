\noindent Cloud services are becoming more and more popular in these days. Applications are placed in the sky, and we all expect to have our services and data accessible regardless of device or location. Systems and applications are relying on cloud servers to protect and store their data, while still being reasonably fast. Homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic encryption scheme able to perform operations on encrypted data without decrypting it first, which makes it a possibly game changer for cloud storage if implemented efficiently and securely. 

CryptDB is a practical homomorphic encryption scheme for SQL queries enabling storage and processing of encrypted data. Its main component is a proxy server which is responsible for intercepting and rewriting queries that are sent between user and server. Data items are encrypted multiple times using different encryption schemes in order to provide confidentiality while still being able to execute most operations seen in regular SQL traces. This report assesses the different encryption schemes used in CryptDB along with its security and limitations. It also describes how to install and set up CryptDB, along with a demonstration application to assess and demonstrate some of its use-cases.
