\section{Problem}

Cloud services are becoming larger and more complex. Users want their content available in the cloud, and easily access to it. Companies such as Apple, [flere] are looking into health information and how your personal information can be integrated in their services. Medical research facilities stores tremendous amounts of personal data, and currently looking into how to share their research material across facilities and borders. \cite{iDASH} Along with these type of sensitive data, follows great responsibility and security measures. 


- Homomorphic encryption to the rescue. Even if the developer of a new system that needs to store sensitive information follows the guidelines of best-practice of cryptographic storage, he will still face problems.

The idea of a homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme is to enable the system to query and compute on encrypted data (ciphertexts) without the need of decrypting it first.
