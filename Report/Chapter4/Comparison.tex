Should compare CryptDB to another HE-database. Perhaps MuteDB ? \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6977940}


The authors of CryptDB has taken the idea further with Mylar (\url{https://css.csail.mit.edu/mylar/} which I assume to be CryptDB 2.0, or at least building on the main idea. Have not studied yet.
